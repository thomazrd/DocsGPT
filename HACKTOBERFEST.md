Deciding to contribute with code? Here are some insights based on the area of your interest:

Frontend (⚛️React, Vite):
    Most of the code is located in /frontend folder. You can also check out our React extension in /extensions/react-widget.
    For design references, here's the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/OXLtrl1EAy885to6S69554/DocsGPT?node-id=0%3A1&t=hjWVuxRg9yi5YkJ9-1).
    Ensure you adhere to the established guidelines.

Backend (🐍Python):
    Focus on /application or /scripts. However, avoid the files ingest_rst.py and ingest_rst_sphinx.py as they are soon to be deprecated.
    Newly added code should come with relevant unit tests (pytest).
    Refer to the /tests folder for test suites.
