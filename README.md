## Project structure
- Application - Flask app (main application)

- Extensions - Chrome extension

- Scripts - Script that creates similarity search index and store for other libraries. 

- Frontend - Frontend uses Vite and React

## QuickStart

Note: Make sure you have Docker installed

1. Download and open this repository with `git clone https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT.git`
2. Create a .env file in your root directory and set the env variable OPENAI_API_KEY with your OpenAI API key and  VITE_API_STREAMING to true or false, depending on if you want streaming answers or not
   It should look like this inside:
   
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=Yourkey
   VITE_API_STREAMING=true
   SELF_HOSTED_MODEL=false
   ```
   See optional environment variables in the `/.env-template` and `/application/.env_sample` files.
3. Run `./run-with-docker-compose.sh`
4. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/

To stop just run Ctrl + C

## Development environments

### Spin up mongo and redis
For development only 2 containers are used from docker-compose.yaml (by deleting all services except for Redis and Mongo). 
See file [docker-compose-dev.yaml](./docker-compose-dev.yaml).

Run
```
docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml build
docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml up -d
```

### Run the backend

Make sure you have Python 3.10 or 3.11 installed.

1. Export required environment variables
```commandline
export CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0   
export CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://localhost:6379/1
export MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/docsgpt
```
2. Prepare .env file
Copy `.env_sample` and create `.env` with your OpenAI API token
3. (optional) Create a Python virtual environment
```commandline
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```
4. Change to `application/` subdir and install dependencies for the backend
```commandline
cd application/ 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the app `python wsgi.py`
6. Start worker with `celery -A app.celery worker -l INFO`

### Start frontend 
Make sure you have Node version 16 or higher.

1. Navigate to `/frontend` folder
